# Try-Data-Science
Some simple iniziation for my project into Data Science World


This is my first Data Science work.

For this project i use German Credit Risk Dataset by Prof. Hofmann. 
In this dataset there are 10 columns in total with 9 indpendent variables and 1 dependent variable which is the target variable
The target variable is binary classication cases with 'Good' and 'Bad' Risk Grade Classification

I'm using R for doing this project. 

And for the flow of this project look like this :
1. Data Understanding (understanding the dataset for each columns also with the description as well)
2. Doing EDA (Explore about the behavior of this data in statistical way)
3. Data Preparation (Checking and droping some columns that have little contribution in this project)
4. Modeling (Using Logistic Regression and Random Forest)
5. Compare between the two models 

Some Notes:
1. Since the target variable is imbalance, so in this project i also handling this issue using Oversampling method
2. This is just simple classification whether the client is on 'Good' or 'Bad' Risk only, so it still lack of complexity
3. Since this project is still simple, so it will be updated or improved later to bring more good result


Thanks!
